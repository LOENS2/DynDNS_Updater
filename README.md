# DynDNS_Updater

Simple program to automatically update the DynDNS ip address of your STRATO domain.

You have to run the jar with the help of a .bat file:
    java -Dfile.encoding=windows-1252 -jar DynDNS_Updater.jar
    
Java 8 is required due to a xml handler!

To change the credentials after the first time setup, just delete the "credentials.txt".
